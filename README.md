* Use of jQuery's "ajax" method to fetch data using the WP REST API both with a GET request (for adding a new quote to the          front page) and a POST request (for submitting a new quote to the site.)
* Using WordPress as a content management system (CMS).
* Using php functions to request data from php pages.
